# Processing examples

Collection of process chain and actinia module examples

Some process chain examples are stored in [process-chains](https://github.com/actinia-org/processing-examples/blob/main/process-chains). In the [README](https://github.com/actinia-org/processing-examples/blob/main/process-chains/README.md) are some example call which can be easily tested with [actinia.mundialis.de](actinia.mundialis.de).

Actinia-modules are templates for actinia process chains, so that the call of a complex process is simple. Some examples are stored in [actinia-modules](https://github.com/actinia-org/processing-examples/blob/main/actinia-modules).

For a general introduction to actinia see e.g. [actinia-introduction](https://neteler.gitlab.io/actinia-introduction/).
